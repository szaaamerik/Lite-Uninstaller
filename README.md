## What inspired the creation of this app?

Allow me to introduce myself â€” Merik, someone who loves experimenting with all kinds of software.

Over time, my computer got cluttered with a lot of applications, including trial versions and programs I hadn't used in ages.

One day, in attempt to free space, I found questionable uninstallers or an old cracked version of the uninstall tool from shady sources.

This prompted me to start a research for tools capable of easily and completely removing any application from my system.

Throughout my quick research, I discovered a lack of free and open-source apps capable of fully uninstalling applications.

Despite the availability of numerous paid and shady tools, I felt uncomfortable using them.

This gave me the idea to create a fully free and open-source app, designed to completely remove applications.
